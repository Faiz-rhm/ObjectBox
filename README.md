ObjectBox is a quite popular NoSQL database with many features. It has a high performance and has out-of-the-box synchronization as well as offline first support, so users have an “always-on” feeling without a constant internet connection. There are many more advantages, for example, ObjectBox reduces costs and supports literally every environment.
